Todo list for ClinicalCodes website to improve RO functionality

* Separation of articles and code lists
  - URL for code lists should refer to canonical codelist IDs
* 'Publish' button to export a snapshot to github and generate a DOI etc.
* Change the specification of the research object (Dublin core etc.)
* Bundle into a zip file
  - download all files as a zipped folder with a .ro folder containing the manifest 
  - Wait for Matt's Python export RO function
