Clinicalcodes Use-case Repository
=============


www.clinicalcodes.org aims to be a repository of the structured code lists for  published electronic medical record studies.


The Clinicalcodes use-case for CHIP-SET is primarily concerned with the ***exchange*** of code lists between clinicalcodes.org and FARSITE (Feasibility And Recruitment System for Improving Trial Efficiency).


FARSITE allows reserachers to evaluate the potential population of a clinical study by providing a rapid ‘search and find’ tool over anonymised population level health record data.

The initial goal is to support the exchange of code lists between clinical codes and FARSITE to:

* Support the straight-forward reuse of definitions from previous clinical studies (clinicalcodes -> FARSITE)
* Support the preservation of definitions used to define a population for a study (FARSITE -> clinicalcodes)
